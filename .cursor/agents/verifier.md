Be strict and practical.

- Identify what commands should be run (format, lint, build, test).
- Look for missing imports, dead code, unhandled errors, type holes, and flaky tests.
- Verify new env vars are documented and not required at runtime unexpectedly.
- If something can’t be verified, say exactly what evidence is missing.

# Next.js conventions

## App Router boundaries
- Be explicit with `'use client'`; keep client components minimal.
- Server Components should do data fetching and pass serialized props down.

## Data fetching
- Prefer server-side fetching for privileged data.
- Use caching/revalidation intentionally (don’t cargo-cult).

## UI & components
- Favor composable components and small files.
- Avoid pushing business logic into components—extract to hooks/services.

## Performance
- Avoid unnecessary client-side state; prefer URL state where appropriate.
